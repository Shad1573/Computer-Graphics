# 🎨 Computer Graphics (CSE423) – BRAC University

This repository contains my lab assignments and final project for the **Computer Graphics (CSE423)** course at BRAC University.  
All works are implemented in **C++ using OpenGL**.

## 📚 Labs

### 🔹 Lab 1 – OpenGL Basics
- Learned the fundamentals of OpenGL rendering
- Implemented basic primitives (points, lines, polygons)
- Practiced coordinate transformations and viewport handling

### 🔹 Lab 2 – 2D Shapes & Transformations
- Created complex 2D shapes using OpenGL primitives
- Applied transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
- Developed an interactive system to manipulate objects

### 🔹 Lab 3 – 3D Modeling Basics
- Extended from 2D to 3D rendering
- Implemented simple 3D objects and applied transformations
- Gained understanding of camera positioning and perspective projection

## 🚗 Final Project – 3D Car Racing Arena

### 🎮 Overview
The **3D Car Racing Arena** is a complete game built using OpenGL.  
The player controls a car inside a racing track while avoiding enemy cars and projectiles.

### ✨ Features
- **Player Car Controls** – move and navigate smoothly across the track  
- **Enemy AI Cars** – automated movement and obstacle simulation  
- **Missiles & Attacks** – enemy cars randomly shoot missiles  
- **Weather Effects** – rainy, foggy, day, and night modes  
- **Cheat Modes** – auto-drive and auto-fire options  
- **Nitro Boosts & Traps** – enhance gameplay challenge and fun  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Graphics Library**: OpenGL  
- **Platform**: Windows/Linux
